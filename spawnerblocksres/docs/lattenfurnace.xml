	<Title>The Latten Furnace</Title>
	<Line>The Latten Furnace, whose original inventor and name is now lost to time,</Line>
	<Line>is simply the best tool for the begginer lychemist.</Line>
	<Line>Being relatively easy to build and maintain, the furnace permits the extraction</Line>
	<Line>of Ly from any organic matter trown at it, better yet: it's capable of using its</Line>
	<Line>own ashes as a source of fuel! However, the design has it's limits, the Ly</Line>
	<Line>you get from burning ashes is minimal and you can't really store any of the</Line>
	<Line>thing, instead the ly is released to the blocks nearby.</Line>
